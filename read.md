given u code where there are 3 main containers, that display dynamically on a function call, actually the main problem here is that main-container and profile-container look good one after another they typically share good ui inheritance, but when user gets to deepAnalysisContainer, it seems like user has entered another web, task for u is to make it look exactly the same as first two container without changing the functionality, and there are few missing things which do appear in html but not in css, and same for css there are few things which are mentioned but doesnt appear in html, make it look good and functional, i have its js too but look good so there are no changes there
